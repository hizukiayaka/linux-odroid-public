The reason why cec.c is still in staging is that I would like
to have a bit more confidence in the uABI. The kABI is fine,
no problem there, but I would like to let the public API mature
a bit.

Once I'm confident that I didn't miss anything then the cec.c source
can move to drivers/media and the linux/cec.h and linux/cec-funcs.h
headers can move to uapi/linux and added to uapi/linux/Kbuild to make
them public.

Hopefully this will happen later in 2016.
